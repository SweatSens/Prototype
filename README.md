# Electrochemical Analysis Prototype

## Overview

This project aims to develop a versatile and modular prototype designed for small-scale electrochemical analysis. The prototype allows for effortless testing and experimentation, and can serve as the foundation for further scientific exploration and development. It incorporates the ability to measure temperature and pH, and features four independent voltammetry channels (potentiostats) as well as an additional potentiostat dedicated to pH sensing.

## Features

- **Temperature Measurement**: Integrated temperature sensor for real-time monitoring and calibration during experiments.
- **pH Sensing**: A dedicated pH sensor potentiostat for accurate measurement of pH levels.
- **Voltammetry (Potentiostats)**: Four independent potentiostats for conducting electrochemical analysis using voltammetry techniques.

## Getting Started
use the prototype hardware and a serial monitor set at 115200 data bits 8 stop bits 1 and no parity.
